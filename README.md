# Dyno Nodejs Assessment

The intent of this repository is to evaluate a candidate's coding skills, ability 
to capture codebase bad practices and refactoring technique knowledge. 

The codebase, despite being small and straightforward, has errors on it and lacks good typing
since it's using pure Javascript.

The candidate goal is to refactor this application into Typescript code, identify and fix coding
bad practices and code smells. 

# How to Proceed

To be evaluated, the candidate must fork this repo, create a fix/dyno-test branch based on develop
and, once finished, create a PR targeting this repo develop branch.
